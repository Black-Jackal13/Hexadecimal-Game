# Hexadecimal Game

### Pseudocode
This is a game in which a 7-Segment display will show two characters (ranging from 0 to F), and the player
will toggle 8 DPDT Toggle switches to match the binary translation of the displayed message. It will interact
with the raspberry pi, which is controlling everything, and light up a RED or GREEN led when the submit button
is pressed based on whether the sequence is correct or not
